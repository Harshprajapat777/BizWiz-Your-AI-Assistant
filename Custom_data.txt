[ABOUT THE COMPANY]
TechNova Solutions Pvt Ltd is a product and service-based technology company that focuses on building modern, scalable, and intelligent digital solutions for global clients.

TechNova works with clients from industries such as healthcare, fintech, e-commerce, agriculture technology, logistics, and education technology.
Many of its clients use both TechNova’s SaaS products and its engineering services in combination, which enables smoother integrations, faster delivery times, and more stable long-term partnerships.

TechNova emphasizes engineering quality, documentation, security-by-design, and observability from the first day of development.
The teams use modern development stacks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, Python, Java Spring, .NET Core, and Go, along with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
For AI/ML work, TechNova engineers use frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face transformers, and they frequently work on projects involving recommendation engines, chatbots, computer vision, and language understanding systems for enterprise use cases.

The culture at TechNova is described as engineering-first, transparent, and growth-oriented.
Employees are encouraged to contribute to open-source projects, write technical blogs, speak at community events, and continuously learn new technologies.
Internally, the company runs regular tech talks, brown-bag sessions, and hackathons focused on DevOps automation, AI tools, and developer productivity improvements.

[WORKING HOURS AND SHIFT POLICY]
TechNova Solutions operates with a flexible work policy that supports both global clients and employee work-life balance.
Instead of rigid 9-to-5 schedules, the company uses rotation-based shifts aligned with Indian Standard Time (IST) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

Standard Workload
Employees are expected to work an average of 6 to 7 hours per day, depending on project demands and shift assignments.
The organization emphasizes output and ownership over clocking long hours, so teams focus on delivering milestones, resolving incidents, and collaborating effectively within their chosen shift.

Shift Structure
To provide near 24/7 coverage for clients in Asia, Europe, and parts of North America, TechNova has defined multiple shifts:

Shift A – Morning IST:
Typical timings: 6:00 AM to 1:00 PM IST
This shift primarily covers early-morning client interactions, deployments during low-traffic hours, and coordination with Asia-Pacific clients.

Shift B – Day IST:
Typical timings: 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM IST
This is the most common shift, aligning with standard business hours in India.
Most internal meetings, sprint ceremonies, and cross-functional sync-ups are scheduled during this window.

Shift C – Evening IST:
Typical timings: 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM IST
This shift is suited for teams collaborating with European and early US time zones.
It also supports production releases scheduled later in the Indian workday.

Shift D – Night IST / GMT-aligned:
Typical timings: 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM IST (approximately 12:30 PM to 7:30 PM GMT)
This shift is used for projects that require real-time collaboration with clients in Europe and early US Eastern time zones, as well as for 24/7 support teams and critical incident response.

Rotation Policy
Most engineering and support teams follow a weekly rotation in which employees may rotate between shifts depending on project and client needs.
For example, a team might assign members to Shift B and Shift C for one week, and then move some members to Shift A or Shift D in the next week.
The rotation is planned in advance and communicated through internal scheduling tools so that employees can plan their personal commitments.

Core Hours
Regardless of shift, TechNova maintains a set of core collaboration hours where overlap is expected.
Typically, 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM IST is treated as a core window where key meetings, cross-team discussions, and decision-making sessions are scheduled.
Employees working in earlier or later shifts adjust their start or end times to ensure they can attend necessary core-hour meetings.

Remote and Hybrid Work
TechNova allows a mix of remote, hybrid, and on-site work depending on role and project.
Roughly 40 percent of the workforce works fully remote, while others come to the office for 2–3 days a week or as required for client demos, training sessions, and team-building events.

[FAQ AND GENERAL INFORMATION]
Below are some frequently asked questions that users, clients, and candidates might ask about TechNova Solutions.
This section is written as continuous informational content so that an LLM can extract relevant answers without needing a strict Q&A structure.

Project Duration and Engagement Models
Typical software development projects at TechNova run anywhere from three to six months for a minimum viable product, and longer for complex enterprise systems or multi-phase digital transformation initiatives.
For shorter engagements, the company offers fixed-scope, fixed-price models where deliverables are clearly defined.
For evolving or research-heavy projects, TechNova prefers time-and-materials or dedicated team models, where capacity is allocated and priorities can be adjusted sprint by sprint.

Technology Stack and Expertise
TechNova has strong expertise in frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, along with native and cross-platform mobile development using Kotlin, Swift, and React Native or Flutter.
On the backend, teams work with Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, and Go, selected based on performance, ecosystem, and client preferences.
Databases commonly used include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and cloud-native databases and data warehouses.
For AI and data projects, the company uses tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow, and other data pipeline technologies.

Development Process and Quality Practices
The development process is strongly influenced by Agile and DevOps principles.
Most teams follow two-week sprints with clearly defined goals, daily standup meetings, sprint planning sessions, demos, and retrospectives.
Code reviews are mandatory, and all production changes go through automated test suites and CI/CD pipelines before deployment.
Security is treated as a core requirement rather than an afterthought, with threat modeling and secure coding practices built into the process.

Careers and Hiring
People often ask how they can join TechNova as engineers, designers, or managers.
The typical hiring process includes an initial screening, one or more technical interviews, and a culture fit or behavioral interview.
Candidates are encouraged to apply through the careers portal or send their resume to the HR email address.
Internships are also available for students who are interested in learning modern software development practices on real-world projects.

Remote Work and Flexibility
TechNova supports remote work across multiple locations and time zones, and many roles are open to fully remote arrangements.
Remote employees collaborate using tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Jira, Confluence, GitHub, and GitLab.
The shift-based model and focus on core hours help distributed teams stay aligned while still giving individuals flexibility in their daily schedules.

Products and Open Source
While TechNova’s primary products like NovaAI, NovaFlow, NovaSecure, and NovaStack are offered as commercial SaaS or licensed solutions, the company also maintains several open-source libraries and developer tools.
These projects typically focus on developer productivity, observability utilities, integration helpers, SDKs, and templates that benefit both internal teams and the wider developer community.

Billing, Pricing, and Payment Terms
For services, TechNova usually structures payments as a combination of upfront deposits, milestone-based payments, and final delivery payments.
For SaaS products, billing can be monthly or annual, with volume-based pricing tiers according to number of users, API calls, or data volume.
Enterprise customers can negotiate custom contracts that include SLAs, dedicated support, and compliance requirements.

Support and Service Levels
Support plans range from standard business-hours support to premium 24/7 coverage with defined response times for critical, high, medium, and low-severity incidents.
Customers raising tickets through the portal can track their status, communicate with support engineers, and access knowledge base articles that address common issues and configuration questions.
